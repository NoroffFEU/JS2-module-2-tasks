# JS2-module-2-tasks

## Overview

Youâ€™ll be given JavaScript files containing several functions that have unclear or poorly chosen names and incomplete functionality.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze** the code to understand the purpose of each function.
2. **Create** The functions based on comments/JSDoc
3. **Refactor** the code by:
   - Renaming functions to have clear, descriptive names that reflect their intended purpose.
   - Completing any unfinished logic within the functions as needed.
   - Rewrite functions to use modern JavaScript functionality where applicable.
   - Organizing the code into separate modules based on functionality to improve structure and readability.

## Goal

Write clean, modular code that is easy to understand and maintain.
